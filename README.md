# Pixelify üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Mitmik


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Pareekshith K R CET Trivandrum


### Project Description
Upload any picture, and we‚Äôll smash it into colorful confetti arranged by wavelength ‚Äî yes, physics meets potato art! Then guess which color is boss in a silly game that unlocks new funky shapes. Warning: May cause rainbow addiction.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever stared at an image and wondered, ‚ÄúWhat if my photo was a psychedelic banana or a starburst of colors ordered by actual science?‚Äù Neither have we, but now you can live that dream.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We take your pixels, map their secret wavelengths (because colors have secrets too), and splatter them into weird shapes like circles, bananas, and stars. Then we challenge your color IQ with a guessing game ‚Äî win points, unlock shapes, and bask in glory.
